# TypeUI

Bootstrap getting old hat? SemanticUI too heavy? Prefer React and TypeScript? TypeUI is a suite of UI components built in 100% TypeScript. It's light-weight, and it uses styled-components to allow you to serve everything as a single JavaScript file.

## Installation

npm install typeui --save
