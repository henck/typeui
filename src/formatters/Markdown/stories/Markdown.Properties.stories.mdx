# Markdown

The `Markdown` formatter takes a markdown string (source) and renders
HTML, with TypeUI components thrown in where necessary.

This formatter requires the following support packages:
* `ReactMarkdown`
* `remarkGfm` (for table support)

<ArgsTable of={Markdown}/>

## Example

export const Template = (args) =>
<Markdown {...args}/>

export const template = 
  "# Heading 1\n"
+ "## Heading 2\n"
+ "### Heading 3\n"
+ "#### Heading 4\n"
+ "##### Heading 5\n"
+ "###### Heading 6\n"
+ "\n"
+ "### List support\n"
+ "\n"
+ "* There once was a wonderful star\n"
+ "* Who thought she would go very far\n"
+ "* Until she fell down\n"
+ "* And looked like a clown\n"
+ "* She knew she would never go far.\n"
+ "\n"
+ "### Table support\n"
+ "\n"
+ "| Syntax | Description |\n"
+ "| ----------- | ----------- |\n"
+ "| Header | Title |\n"
+ "| Paragraph | Text |\n"
+ "\n"
+ "### Image support\n"
+ "\n"
+ "![Joe](https://react.semantic-ui.com/images/avatar/large/elliot.jpg)\n"
+ "\n";
