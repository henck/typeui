## Panel.Icon

The `Panel.Icon` component is a shortcut to building a `Panel` that opens when an
`Icon` is clicked. Note that the `Panel.Icon` must still be placed inside a container
that is relatively positioned, and that the only way to close the panel is to click
outside it.

An icon can be passed as an icon type, or as a collection of icon properties.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Panel.Icon"
    args={{ open: true, padded: true, icon: "layers" }}>
    {args =>   
    <div style={{position: 'relative'}}>
      <Panel.Icon {...args}>
        <p>This is some panel text.</p>
      </Panel.Icon>
    </div>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# Panel.Content 

The standard `Panel` has no padding. Padding can be added, or you can use the `Panel.Header`, 
`Panel.Content` and `Panel.Footer` components. These add padding, and different background colors.

The components also take care of applying rounded borders to their content so as not to interfere with
the Panel's own rounded borders.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Panel.Content"
    args={{ open: true, icon: "layers" }}>
    {args =>   
    <div style={{position: 'relative'}}>
      <Panel.Icon {...args}>
        <Panel.Header>
          Header
        </Panel.Header>
        <Panel.Content>
          <p>This is some panel text.</p>
        </Panel.Content>
        <Panel.Footer>
          <Button secondary>Close</Button>
        </Panel.Footer>
      </Panel.Icon>
    </div>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
