# Panel

A standard `Panel`.

Note that a panel determines its position from the position of its direct parent.
The parent therefore **must** have `position: relative`.

Extra spacing was given to this story in order to illustrate how a panel will
appear above or below, or left or right, of its parent based on the screen 
location.

<ArgsTable of={Panel}/>

## Standard Panel

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Properties"
    args={{ open: true, padded: true, children: "Panel content." }}>
    {args =>   
    <div style={{position: 'relative', background: 'gray'}}>
      Anchor
      <Panel {...args}/>
    </div>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
