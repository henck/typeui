## Dialog.Alert

The `Dialog` component offers a pre-built `Dialog.Alert` type, with an "OK" button.
The caller provides a `title`, and any JSX inside the component is used as dialog content.

export const AlertTemplate = (args) => 
<div style={{height: '300px'}}>
  <Dialog.Alert {...args}/>
</div>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Dialog.Alert"
    args={{ open: true, title: "Lunch", children: "It's lunchtime!" }}>
    {AlertTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Dialog.Confirm

The `Dialog` component offers a pre-built `Dialog.Confirm` type, with a "Yes" and a "No" button.
The caller provides a `title`, and any JSX inside the component is used as dialog content.

If Yes is clicked, then the `onConfirm` callback is called.

export const ConfirmTemplate = (args) => 
<div style={{height: '300px'}}>
  <Dialog.Confirm {...args}/>
</div>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Dialog.Confirm"
    args={{ open: true, title: "Ice cream", children: "Would you like ice cream?" }}>
    {ConfirmTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Dialog.Xhr

The `Dialog` component offers a pre-built `Dialog.Xhr` type, with an "OK" and a "Retry" button.
This dialog can be used when an XHR request fails. It takes an `error` attribute with an Axios response object,
and reports it to the user, providing a title and text that describe the error 
that the asynchronous operation encountered.

The Retry button only appears if the `onRetry` callback is provided. 
If the user chooses to Retry the operation, then the `onRetry` callback is called.

export const XhrTemplate = (args) =>
<div style={{height: '300px'}}>
  <Dialog.Xhr {...args}/>
</div>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Dialog.Xhr"
    args={{ open: true, onRetry: () => {}, error: {response:{status:404}} }}>
    {XhrTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
