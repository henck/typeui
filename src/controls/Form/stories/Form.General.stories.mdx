## Field

A `Form.Field` wraps a form control. It serves several purposes.

First, the Field automatically adds `name`, `onChange`, `value` and `error`
props to the control it contains. The `onChange` prop is supplied by the Form
content so that the developer does not need to add it.

Second, the Field performs validation when it is mounted, whenever its control's value 
changes, and when it is unmounted. Validation results are send directly to the parent
Form (using Context, again).

A Field may provide a `hint` prop - which can be any JSX - which is shown under the
control.

A Field may add any number of validation rules, e.g. `required={{message:"This field is required"}}`.
Each rule is a prop. Rules include `rquired`, `isInt`, `minLength` etc.

When a field is first mounted, it is pristine. Even when its content is invalid, it will
not show any validation error. When the user edits the fields, it will no longer be 
pristine and any errors will appear. The parent Form also provides a `dirty` prop to the
Field. When the Form is dirty, so are its fields, and any validation errors are shown, pristine or not.

For dark backgrounds, fields may set their `contrast` prop to true to use lighter error colors.

export const FieldTemplate = (args) =>
<Form {...args}>
  <Form.Field
    required={{message: "Employee first name is required."}}
    width={1} label="First name"
    name="employee_firstname" 
    value={"test"}
    control={(<Input type="text" placeholder="First name" fluid/>)}
    hint={<span>Please provide the employee's first name, e.g. <kbd>John</kbd></span>}/>
</Form>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Field"
    args={{ data: {}, onChange: () => {}, onValidate : () => {} }}>
    {FieldTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Uncontrolled controls

Components may wish to show a control wrapped in a field, without the
overhead of a Form, while still benefiting from Field formatting. 

The `Uncontrolled` element accepts a `label` and a `hint`, but no validation
rules (and thus shows no errors). It also does not provide an onChange
handler to its control; the calling code must do that.

The field's control is also not provided as a prop, but as a child.

export const UncontrolledTemplate = (args) =>
<Form {...args}>
  <Form.Uncontrolled
    width={1} label="First name"
    hint={<span>Please provide the employee's first name, e.g. <kbd>John</kbd></span>}>
    <Input type="text" placeholder="First name" fluid/>
  </Form.Uncontrolled>
</Form>

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Uncontrolled"
    args={{ data: {}, onChange: () => {}, onValidate : () => {} }}>
    {UncontrolledTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
