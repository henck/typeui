  <Accordion.Tab title="How do you acquire a dog?">
    Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from pet shops, private owners, or shelters.
    A pet shop may be the most convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog from a private owner allows you to assess the pedigree and upbringing of your dog before choosing to take it home. Lastly, finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good home to a dog who may not find one so readily.

## align

An Accordion's expand/collapse carets can have an `align` of `left` (default) or `right`.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="align"
    args={{align: 'right'}}>
    {DefaultTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## noanimate 

The Accordion's sliding animation can be turned off with `noanimate`.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="noanimate"
    args={{noanimate: true, styled: true}}>
    {DefaultTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## styled 

A `styled` Accordion adds basic formatting.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="styled"
    args={{styled: true}}>
    {DefaultTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## raised 

A `raised` Accordion (with `styled` set) gets an extra-deep drop shadow.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="raised"
    args={{raised: true, styled: true}}>
    {DefaultTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
