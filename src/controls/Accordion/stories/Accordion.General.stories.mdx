## active

The default active tab of an `Accordion` can be specified with the `active` 
property. This is actually an *array* of currently active tabs. The indices 
are 0-based.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="active"
    args={{ active: [1] }}>
    {DefaultTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## multiple 

A `multiple` Accordion is non-exclusive and allows multiple tabs to be open at 
the same time.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="multiple"
    args={{ raised: true, styled: true, multiple: true, active: [1] }}>
    {DefaultTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## title

The _required_ `title` attribute of an `Accordion.Tab` can be any JSX, so it's possible 
to include an icon in the title (or anything else).

export const TitleTemplate = (args) =>
<Accordion {...args}>
  <Accordion.Tab title={<Flex.Quick><Icon name="code"/> What is a dog?</Flex.Quick>}>
    A dog is a type of domesticated animal. Known for its loyalty and faithfulness, it can be found as a welcome guest in many households across the world.
