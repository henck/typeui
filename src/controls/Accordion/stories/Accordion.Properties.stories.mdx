# Accordion

An `Accordion` is used to group content in panes that can be expanded individually. 
These panes can be styled and animated, and the pane titles can contain any JSX.

By default, an Accordion only allows one pane to be open at any time. A `multiple` 
Accordion allows users to expand multiple panes. 

<ArgsTable of={Accordion}/>
